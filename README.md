![The Belles of Three Spires Site](/assets/documentation/s-shot-index-page.PNG)

This website was created to promote the barbershop chorus, The Belles of Three Spires. The main purpose of the site is to inform 
people about the Belles, and about barbershop music in general. Users will also be able to contact the Belles through the 
contact form in order to make a booking or to enquire about booking, and also find their location.

Barbershop music is a stripped back style, with no music or embellishments to suport the vocals. Due to this it was decided that 
the site should follow a similar ethos, a stripped back site which enables the content to be the main feature. This creates a
site that is clean and easy to navigate.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The main colours chosen for the site are hot pink and charcoal grey.

The Belles singout outfit consists of a fleece jacket in a similar colour to that used in the site. As the hot pink
is a bright and modern colour, I have paired it with the classic dark grey shown in the text boxes. As well as being 
aesthetically pleasing and easy to read with a good contrast, the combination of modern and classic also mirrors the 
Belles' performance style.    

The charcoal grey of the header and footer is also used throughout the body of the site in text boxes. 

## Typography

There are two main fonts used in the site. Dancing script, with a backup of the cursive font is used for "The Belles of 
Three Spires" and also for the page titles. This font matches font that is used for the Belles on their marketing 
material. All other text uses the lato font, with the backup font of sans serif. This is a clean and easy to read font 
which fits in with the simple style of the site and also contracts nicely with the script of the headers.

## Wireframes

The wireframes for the site were created in balsamiq and uploaded as a pdf. They can be found [here.](assets/documentation/belles-wireframe.pdf)
